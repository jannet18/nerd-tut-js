- Higher order functions.

* Concept in programming where functions take other functions as arguements or return them as results.
* In Js functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be treated as values,passed as arguements ot other functions and returned as values from functions.
* .map() - a function that takes an array of values and applies a transformation to each value in the array.it does not mutate the original array
  ** implicit return - the value is automatically returned without the need for the return keyword.
  const arr = [ 1, 2,3,4]
  const output = arr.map((num) => num+=10)
  ** Implicit type Conversion \*\*
* also known as coercion - occurrs when a programming language automatically converts one data type to another without explicit instructions from the programmer.

** Explicit return **

- requires the use of a return keyword to specify the value the function should return.
- block statements with no explicit return , iplicitly returns undefined by default

\*\* EXPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION

- occurs when a programmer explicitly converts a value from one data value to another using functions or operations.
  const numString = '42';
  const num = parseInt(numString) - explicitly converts a string to an integer.
